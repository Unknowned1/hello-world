# hello-world
just another repository (tutorial )

Hello to everyone
i am a student at university of Salerno (Italy).
i don't speak English very well (i am not a mother tongue :D).
i study informatics and i am at first year of university.
Unfortunately i know only C language at the moment (and not too well).
I am on github for my passion for programming and because i want to learn
more about programming.
I would like to meet any "hacker" if it's possible :D.

Thanks to everyone and Greetings :)
